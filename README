5. A declaration that all of the code you are submitting was written by you 
We (Albert Wang, Jon Wong, Roy Bae and Joey Shin of G20), declare that all code submitted in this project was written by us.

6. Instructions for building and running your project. The instructions must be sufficiently detailed for us to set up and run your application.

a. Setup AWS configurations
    Create Tables:
    adsorption → PK(S): “username”, SK(S): “url”
    article_to_user → PK(S) : “link”, SK(S): “username”
    interest_to_article → PK(S): “interest”, SK(N): “inxid”
    interest_to_user → PK(S): “interest”, SK(S): “username”
    interest_to_article → PK(S): “keyword”, SK(N): “newsID”
    messages → PK(N): “msg_id”
    news → PK(S): “link”
    posts → PK(N): “ID”
    rooms → PK(N): “room_id”
    users → PK(S): “username”
b. Run “npm install” inside of the root project directory
c. Run "node app.js" inside of the root project directory to launch the application
d. Click "Sign Up" and create a new user profile
e. Connect to your livy cluster
    If you are having issues with this and want to run the algorithm, you can do the following: 
    Go to ComputeRankLivy.java
    Delete all instances of livy and “client”
    Simply add: SocialRankJob sr = new SocialRankJob(); sr.initialize(); sr.run();
    Run ComputeRankLivy.java
